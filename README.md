# Overview
The real world application of this solution is that both companies as well as individuals can use this to choose a location to build their company or live. For example, individuals can find a city based upon weather, salary, etc depending on their personal preferences. Using the general population’s preferences as well as the most popular cities, companies can strategically locate their locations to align with customers which can include financial status, weather, education, etc.

# Data Set
The data set is collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/orhankaramancode/city-quality-of-life-dataset) containing 265 cities and 21 columns.
